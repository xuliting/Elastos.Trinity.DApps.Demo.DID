      If you are here, this means you could register the application profile publicly on the DID sidechain
      and that you are trying to connect to your friend in this app. <br> <br>
      This app is not going to do anything real here, but in a real case, the app could for example link your
      friend's profile to your profile, and start displaying your friend's messages, posts, or anything else.
